# Chess Game with Min-Max Algorithm and Alpha-Beta Pruning

This project implements a chess game where you can play against the computer, which uses the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make its moves.

## Features

- **Chessboard Display**: The game displays the chessboard and pieces after each move in the command line interface.
- **Move Tracking**: The game keeps track of moves made by both players.
- **Checkmate Detection**: Detects when a player is in checkmate and declares the winner.
- **Stalemate Detection**: Detects when a stalemate occurs and declares a draw.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the `chess_game.py` file using Python: `python chess_game.py`.

## Game Instructions

- You'll be prompted to choose initial and new positions for your moves.
- Follow the prompts to make your moves.
- The computer will then make its moves using the Min-Max Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- The game continues until checkmate or stalemate is detected.

## Contributions

Contributions to improve the game's features, optimize the algorithm, or fix bugs are welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
